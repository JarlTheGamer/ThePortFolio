When I started working on this game studio I started it as a so called "Roblox Myth" that is a horror story about a person or multiple people that people can go investigate and find all the stuff that has happened.

It grew slowly to 100 group members and then I found a pretty big youtuber called [Kreekcraft](https://youtube.com/@KreekCraft), I send him a message a few months after I created the myth and he played the game in december 2022. It was a really big thing that a famous youtuber played my game

> â€œI did not learn anything from tutorials, but I just continued scripting until I got good at it.

Most of the time when I script I do it for fun. I have helped lots of people making games and I have made alot of friends through out making The Oil Factory. There are still alot of things that need to be changed until the games that the studio has are good and I actually can recommend it.

My time making this project was some of the most fun time I have ever had and it helped me get alot more experience with scripting overal and thought me to just not give up and continue even tho a project is failing.
